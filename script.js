// 1. Above is a list of 99 names. Print out the 10th item on this list


// 2. Print out the length of the list (it should be 99).


// 3. An empty list called someNames has been created below. Using a built in method, add 5 names from the manyNames list to the someNames list (you can use random numbers or hard code a value).
var someNames = [];



// 4. Write a for loop that prints out the name of each person.




// 5. Now iterate over the list and print out only the names which have more than 6 letters in them. Store these names in a list called longNames




// 6. Iterate over the list and find the longest name in the whole thing. 
// Then print out "The longest name in the list is ______. It has ___ letters in it."





// 7. Make a second list called shortNames that contains all names that are 6 letters or shorter






// 8. Print out the longNames and shortNames lists.




// 9. Are there more long names or short names? Write code to figure that out.





// 10. Iterate over them all and print out only the names that include the letter "a". Store these names in a list called namesWithA. NOTE: You can check if a value inclues a letter using the .includes method. Be careful about the difference between a and A when checking if a character is present.
