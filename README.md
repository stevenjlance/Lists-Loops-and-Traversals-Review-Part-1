For the first part of today's class, we are going to review some key components of arrays and how to iterate through arrays using a `for` loop.

GOAL
---------
Using your knowledge of arrays and for loops, complete the steps that have been outlined on the `script.js` file. For an components that you may have forgotten, use [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) and other reference materials in order to complete to expectations.

TASKS FOR TODAY
---------------
1. There is a list of 99 names. Print out the 10th item on this list.  
2. Print out the length of the list (it should be 99).  
3. An empty list called someNames has been created below. Using a built in method, add 5 names from the manyNames list to the someNames list (you can use random numbers or hard code a value).  
4. Write a for loop that prints out the name of each person.  
5. Now iterate over the list and print out only the names which have more than 6 letters in them. Store these names in a list called `longNames`. 
6. Iterate over the list and find the longest name in the whole thing. Then print out "The longest name in the list is ______. It has ___ letters in it."  
7. Make a second list called `shortNames` that contains all names that are 6 letters or shorter.  
8. Print out the `longNames` and `shortNames` lists.  
9. Are there more long names or short names? Write code to figure that out.  
10. Iterate over them all and print out only the names that include the letter "a". Store these names in a list called `namesWithA`. NOTE: You can check if a value includes a letter using the `.includes()` method. Be careful about the difference between a and A when checking if a character is present.
